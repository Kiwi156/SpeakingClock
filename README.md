# Speaking Clock Coding Challenge

This is a Java coding challenge I worked on. This was part of a Coding for Testers course in the Serenity Dojo expansion programme. I worked with a Coach during the refactor to clean up the code.  

# Goal 

The goal of this challenge was to design "a Conversational Clock - a cluster of objects, capable of telling the current system time in a conversational format."

# Techniques Learned 

In this exercise I practised Test Drivern Design (TDD) and writing assertions using the assert j library. 

I also practised committing and pushing my code to Git Hub and working through a refactor cycle to improve the code.
