# Speaking Clock Coding Challenge

Java coding challenge I worked on. This was part of a Coding for Testers course in the Serenity Dojo Expansion programme. 

# Goal

Goal of this challenge was to design "a Conversational Clock - a cluster of objects, capable of telling the current system time in a conversational format."

As part of the challenge the expected output for the time was required in a conversational format, for example:

# Techniques Learned 

In this exercise I wrote assertions using the **Assert j library**. I like using the Assert j library because when a test fails there are details to help trouble shoot and resolve the failure. 

I also practised committing and pushing my code to **Git Hub**. This helped me get used to running basic commands from the terminal to do version control. 

Working through a refactor cycle with a Coach from the Expansion programme helped to improve this code. As part of the refactor a **Java Switch Statement** was used to select the Hour or Minutes time in conversational format. 

I used a **Java if..else statement** to tell the time relative to the hour that was closer. 

In this exercise I practised **Test Drivern Design (TDD)**. First I wrote the test including an assertion and ran the test that failed and then I implemented the code. Then I re-ran the test so that a green tick was displayed and checked that all of the other tests still passed.
