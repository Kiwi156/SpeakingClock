# Speaking Clock Coding Challenge

This is a Java coding challenge I worked on. This was part of a Coding for Testers course in the Serenity Dojo Expansion programme. 

# Goal

The goal of this challenge was to design "a Conversational Clock - a cluster of objects, capable of telling the current system time in a conversational format."

As part of the challenge the expected output for the time was required in a conversational format, for example:

# Techniques Learned 

In this exercise I practised Test Drivern Design (TDD) and writing assertions using the Assert j library. I like using the Assert j library because when a test fails there are details to help me trouble shoot and resolve the failure. 

I also practised committing and pushing my code to Git Hub. This helped me get used to running basic commands from the terminal to do version control. 

Working through a refactor cycle with a Coach from the Expansion programme helped to improve this code. As part of the refactor a Java Switch Statement was used to select the Hour or Minutes time in conversational format. A Java if..else statement was used for when the minutes time was closer to the next hour.
